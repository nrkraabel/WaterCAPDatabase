              Helping keep water bills affordable to all households is an
              important goal. This database tracks programs that U.S. water
              utilities use to help customers in need pay their water bills.
              Although we list information on 361 programs tracked from 231
              utilities spanning 40 states, we do not claim the database is
              comprehensive or representative. It uses data collected by both
              the EPA{" "}

              staff and other researchers will help us add and edit data to
              improve it. Building on the EPAâ€™s categorization, we classify
              programs as Bill Discount, Temporary Assistance, Water Efficiency,
              Flexible Terms, and Lifeline Rates
              <a href="./data_doc"> (for more definitions, click here)</a>. To
              find programs for a specific utility, hover over the area on the
              map below or search for the utility to the right. The database
              then provides more detailed information on the type of assistance,
              eligibility, and our estimate of the financial value of the
              program.
